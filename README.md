<h1>About</h1>

Coworking Booking System is a delightfully chaotic console application for booking coworking spaces. 
It is implemented using the MVC pattern, which makes the project scalable (in theory) and gives questionably infinite opportunities for growth.

What makes this project AWESOME

Great structure – everything is in its place (mostly).

Flexibility – easy to expand or to break with equal probability.

Stability – it works against all odds. 

Easy-to-read code – but actually, for sanity reasons, it is better not to read it.

Future possibilities

This project is already cool, but there's so much more fun stuff to add.

A real database (JDBC or something even more fancy) – because storing data in memory is reckless optimistic.

Authorization and authentication – no more anonymous trolls booking all the rooms (until they hack it).

Logging and history tracking – when you need to trace who broke it again.

More incredible features – because who is satisfied with just "functional"?

The system already works almost as expected, which is mildly terrifying.
And rememder: there are no bugs - only undocumented features or "preview mode".
