<h1>About</h1>

<p>Coworking Booking System is a delightfully chaotic console application for booking coworking spaces. </p>
<p>It is implemented using the MVC pattern, which makes the project scalable (in theory) and gives questionably infinite opportunities for growth.</p>

<h2>What makes this project AWESOME</h2>
<ul>
<li>Great structure – everything is in its place (mostly).</li>
<li>Flexibility – easy to expand or to break with equal probability.</li>
<li>Stability – it works against all odds. </li>
<li>Easy-to-read code – but actually, for sanity reasons, it is better not to read it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future possibilities</h2>
<p>This project is already cool, but there's so much more fun stuff to add.</p>
<ul>
<p>A real database (JDBC or something even more fancy) – because storing data in memory is reckless optimistic.</p>
<p>Authorization and authentication – no more anonymous trolls booking all the rooms (until they hack it).</p>
<p>Logging and history tracking – when you need to trace who broke it again.</p>
<p>More incredible features – because who is satisfied with just "functional"?</p>
</ul>
<p>The system already works almost as expected, which is mildly terrifying.</p>
<p>And rememder: there are no bugs - only undocumented features or "preview mode".</p>
